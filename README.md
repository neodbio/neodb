**neodb**  
is a research project, focusing on the development of a data engine written in Rust,
focused on the intersection of columnar time-series storage, streaming data ingestion, and intelligent query execution.

**neodb**  
is an experimental database engine written in Rust, exploring:
- Efficient, columnar storage structures
- A custom query language (`nql`) for time-aware analytics
- Event-aligned, streaming-friendly processing models

**status**  
This project is in **early-stage research and prototyping**.
It is not stable, nor production-ready.

**in-progress**  
- Arrow-native, memory-mapped query execution
- Time-aligned filtering for real-time and historical data
- Actively validating architectural models, benchmarking performance, and experimenting with query abstractions.
- The initial `nql` grammar and parser
- Early versions of the neodb query engine
